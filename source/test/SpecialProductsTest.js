Full HD 1080p resolution, 5M:1 dynamic contrast ratio, and incredibly fast sync time give you pictures that make the most out of any media you are using. LG's 600Hz Sub Field Driving ensures that fast-moving content is delivered in vivid color and striking detail so nothing goes by in a blur. The mega dynamic contrast ratio creates a sense of depth, fine gradation in color and tonal values and a general feeling of \"being there\" once thought impossible on a two-dimensional panel. LG's 2D to 3D conversion feature adds a 3D effect to 2D television, movies, sports, video games and images, at the touch of a button.\r\n\r\nThe 50PZ950 comes with a full complement of inputs, ensuring that you'll be able to hook up any equipment you have or may get in the future. The unit includes four HDMI and two component jacks for high-definition devices. And if one of those devices happens to be a gaming console, gamers will be happy to know that game mode, which speeds up the scaling process, virtually eliminates video lag time.\r\n","image":"product/lg_tv_10.png","detailImage":"product/details/lg_tv_10.png","rating":0},{"id":15,"name":"Apple\n13.3\" MacBook Air Notebook Computer\n\n","category":2,"model":"1015.0","specialProduct":1,"newPrdouct":0,"listPrice":1499,"sellPrice":1400,"description":"    1.7GHz Intel Core i5\n    4GB RAM\n    256GB Flash Storage\n    Intel GMA HD 3000 Graphics\n    13.3\" Glossy Widescreen LED Backlit Display\n    FaceTime Webcam\n    Bluetooth 4.0\n    802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi\n    Mac OS X 10.7 Lion\n    3 lb\n","image":"product/apple_comp_15.png","detailImage":"product/details/apple_comp_15.png","rating":0},{"id":24,"name":"BlackBerry Torch 9800 ","category":3,"model":"1024.0","specialProduct":1,"newPrdouct":1,"listPrice":517,"sellPrice":512,"description":"3g network :\n    Hsdpa 850 / 1900 / 2100 /800\nCard slot :\n    Micro sd, up to 32gb, 4gb card included\nGprs :\n    Class 10 (4+1/3+2 slots), 32 - 48 kbps\nWlan :\n    Wi-fi 802.11 b/g/n, uma (carrier-dependent)\nCpu :\n    624 mhz processor ","image":"product/bb_mobile_24.png","detailImage":"product/details/bb_mobile_24.png","rating":0},{"id":26,"name":"Nokia C6-01 ","category":3,"model":"1026.0","specialProduct":1,"newPrdouct":1,"listPrice":283,"sellPrice":273,"description":"C6-01 is a 3.2 inches Multi-TouchTouchScreen phone with a AMOLED ClearBlack Display that is protected by Scratch and Impact resistant Gorilla Glass.
