Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.3-pound computer.\r\n\r\nThe original MacBook Air's slim profile was made possible due to the lack of an optical drive. This system eschews the hard drive as well -- opting instead for 128GB of flash storage -- resulting in an even slimmer profile. When closed, the computer is only 0.68\" at its thickest point.\r\n\r\nFlash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 5 hours of web browsing and an amazing 30 days of standby time!\r\n\r\nThe MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light.
